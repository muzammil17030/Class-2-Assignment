       <h1 id="lion"> <u>LION:</u></h1>
       <p>Lions are absolutely fascinating creatures! They belong to the Panthera genus and are known scientifically as Panthera leo. These majestic animals are native to various parts of Africa and a small population exists in the Gir Forest of India. Lions are highly social animals and live in groups called prides. A pride typically consists of several related females, their offspring, and a few adult males.

        One of the most iconic features of lions is the magnificent mane that adorns the males. The color and length of the mane can vary, with darker manes often indicating higher testosterone levels and dominance. The mane not only adds to their regal appearance but also serves as a form of protection during fights.
        
        Lions are known for their exceptional hunting skills. While females do the majority of the hunting, males often participate in larger prey captures. Their muscular bodies, sharp claws, and powerful jaws make them formidable predators. They primarily feed on large ungulates such as zebras, wildebeests, and buffalo.
        
        In addition to their hunting prowess, lions are also known for their impressive physical abilities. They can run at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, enabling them to chase down their prey. Lions are also capable swimmers and are not averse to taking a dip in bodies of water to cool off or cross rivers.
        
        Conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of lions, as they have faced significant population declines in recent years. Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching pose serious threats to their existence. Many organizations and governments are working tirelessly to protect these magnificent creatures and ensure their long-term survival.
        
        Overall, lions are truly remarkable animals. Their strength, beauty, and social dynamics make them a captivating species to learn about and appreciate. ü¶Åüî•</p>

            Unfortunately, tigers are facing numerous threats and are considered an endangered species. Habitat loss, poaching, and illegal wildlife trade are the main factors contributing to their declining population. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these incredible animals and ensure their survival for future generations.
            
            Tigers have also played significant roles in various cultures and mythologies. They are often seen as symbols of power, strength, and beauty. In many Asian cultures, tigers are revered and considered sacred animals.
